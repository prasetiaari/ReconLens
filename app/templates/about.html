  <h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">About ReconLens</h1>

  <p class="text-slate-700 mb-4">
    ReconLens was created by <strong>Prasetia Ari</strong>, with continuous support from ChatGPT-5 
    throughout the development process. The tool is inspired by <em>gau-expose</em>, with the original 
    idea of building a more user-friendly UI version so reconnaissance work is not limited to CLI or scripts.
  </p>

  <p class="text-slate-700 mb-4">
    Development started while participating in the <strong>Tangsel Bug Bounty 2025</strong> program. 
    Because of that, many features in ReconLens are directly derived from real bug hunting needs 
    and have been tested in actual bounty scenarios.

  <h2 class="mt-6 font-medium">Our Goals</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-slate-700">
    <li><strong>Simplify reconnaissance workflows</strong> — so security researchers don’t need to constantly juggle multiple scripts manually.</li>
    <li><strong>Provide a practical dashboard</strong> — to visualize and analyze recon results more effectively.</li>
    <li><strong>Pave the way for AI integration</strong> — early experiments have already been implemented, and further development will continue.</li>
  </ul>
