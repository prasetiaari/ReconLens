# About

ReconLens was created by Prasetia Ari, with continuous support from ChatGPT-5 throughout development. It was initially inspired by **gau-expose**, but has since evolved into a more user-friendly UI for recon, ensuring the workflow is not limited to CLI scripts only.

Development started during **Tangsel Bug Bounty 2025**, so many features come from real bug-hunting needs and have been tested in bounty scenarios.

## Our goals
1. Simplify recon workflows — no more juggling multiple scripts manually.
2. Practical dashboard — visualize and analyze recon results quickly.
3. AI integration path ~~— early experiments included; more to come.~~

## Features (quick)
1. Subdomain enumeration support (Amass, Subfinder, Findomain)
2. URL collection: GAU and Waymore for gathering endpoints and archived URLs.
3. Path probing: Dirsearch and other directory-fuzzing tools for probing paths.
4. Sensitive path detection & classification modules — detect and categorize endpoints such as admin, auth, api, upload, docs, and dev/staging
5. FastAPI-based web UI (dashboard + graphs)

## ReconLens Workflow

 **1. Add Target**
 
 Start by adding a target domain or scope.
 
 **2. URL Collection**
 
 Use GAU or Waymore to gather archived URLs from various sources.
 
 **3. Build Module**
 
 Use the Build Module to process and categorize the URLs gathered by GAU/Waymore. Categorization makes analysis easier and organizes results into actionable modules.
 
 
***Complete the three steps above as the initial setup.*** After that, you can open the Subdomain Menu or other menus that were dynamically generated by the Build Module.
 
**4. Subdomain Menu**

In this menu you can:
 - **(re)collect subdomains** using tools like Subfinder, Amass, and/or Findomain to discover and add subdomains.
 - **(re)probe subdomains** to check whether discovered subdomains are active (HTTP/HTTPS).
 - run **dirsearch** to brute-force directories and paths.

**5. Other Modules (Dynamically Created by Build Module)**
In these menus you can:
- **(re)probe** — run active probes against URLs contained within the respective module.
